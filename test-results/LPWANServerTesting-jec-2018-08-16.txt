Testing results:

- On create, get nasty message about not being authorized.

- ttn-c-good
        PASS

- ttn-c-bad-url 
        Get error, but not very informative error message.  Looks like
        server should recognize that 404 indicates bad URL.
        SPS: error messages not coming back from server.  Dan will fix soon

- ttn-c-bad-client - 
        "Client not found" from TTN
        SPS: FE pass.  BE: FAIL. no error message, no auth flag
   
- ttn-c-bad-secret
        Similar to tc2 - 401 should indicate bad client secret.
        SPS: error messages not coming back from server.  Dan will fix soon
- ttn-bad-oauth-good-data
- ttn-bad-oauth-bad-data
        TTN basically traps us until un/pw is valid.  No callback.

- tc7 (add) - Make sure TTN has 3rd party app deleted.  Reject request.
  - Gets Rejected error from TTN - PASS
  
- tu1 - Same issue as tc5 & 6.  Once logged in, proceeds.

- tu2 - Fixed tc2.  PASS

- tu3 - Fixed tc3.  PASS

- tu4 - Fixed tc4.  PASS

- Maybe add a test case - user revolks 3rd party access.  How does server
  handle?  UI?
