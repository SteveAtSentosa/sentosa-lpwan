Testing results:

- On create, get nasty message about not being authorized.

- tc1 - PASS

- tc2 - Get error, but not very informative error message.  Looks like
        server should recognize that 404 indicates bad URL.

- tc3 - "Client not found" from TTN
   
- tc4 - Similar to tc2 - 401 should indicate bad client secret.

- tc5 & tc6 - TTN basically traps us until un/pw is valid.  No callback.

- tc7 (add) - Make sure TTN has 3rd party app deleted.  Reject request.
  - Gets Rejected error from TTN - PASS
  
- tu1 - Same issue as tc5 & 6.  Once logged in, proceeds.

- tu2 - Fixed tc2.  PASS

- tu3 - Fixed tc3.  PASS

- tu4 - Fixed tc4.  PASS

- Maybe add a test case - user revolks 3rd party access.  How does server
  handle?  UI?
